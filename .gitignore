# Archives (if they are build artifacts, temporary downloads, or unzipped folders you don't want to track)
# Consider if you need to version specific .zip files.
# If you extract zips and don't need the extracted folder, add its pattern.
*.zip
# Example based on your file structure:
# If 'scripts/insert-data_v3.ps1.zip/' is an extracted folder from a zip and not needed:
# scripts/insert-data_v3.ps1.zip/

# Specific to files that might be generated by your notebooks or scripts:
# If your .ipynb files or .ps1 scripts create specific output files with
# consistent names or extensions that you don't want to track, add them here.
# For example, if 'Solar_Simulator_timeseries_report_V1.ipynb' generates 'report_output.pdf':
# report_output.pdf

# If any of your PowerShell scripts in the 'scripts/' directory produce
# local configuration, cache, or output files that shouldn't be in git:
# scripts/*.local
# scripts/output_from_ps1/
